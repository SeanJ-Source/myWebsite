					<p>You know that feeling you got in the pit of your stomach the night before Christmas? Now times that by a million.</p>
					<p>
						What's at stake? Bragging rights, if you're able to win this game you're buying peace. You lose, 365 days of pain.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Michigan Ohio St rivalry is as ingrained in midwestern culture as stoicism and self-reliance.</p>
					<p>
						Its one of the oldest and most deeply rooted rivalries in American Sports, preceding baseball's first World Series by six years and the NFL by a quarter century. 
					</p>
					<p>Since 1935, the game has been held on the final week of the regular season, the BIG 10 Championship and a shot at a National Championship oftentimes at stake.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					
					<p>But even in a down year, the chance to play spoiler to one's foe can equally be satisfiying, turning a lost season into one of lasting triumph.</p>
					
						<p> like the fruits of the season's harvest, the game is a gift, a cycle of life that links generations and bonds hostile neighbors because beneath the bitterness that coats their epic feud, teams grudgingly maintain a mutual and abiding respect, they're companion pieces in history, each side's legacy continually tied to the others.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's a beautiful thing, you feel you are a part of something that stretches from before you existed and will be here long after you are gone.
					</p>
					<p>
						The cold forbidding sky of that late November day, in Ann Arbor or in Columbus set a tone for the whole year.
				
						Either being the victor or having been humiliated by your rival.
